# gh-workflows-project.github.io

- The pages source in the repo settings has to be main branch and folder docs for this to work. 
- The apps folders under docs will be auto deployed to github pages at h-workflows-project.github.io/app_path_to_index.html.
- You can disable auto runs of the github provided action on every commit by changing the pages setting to github actions instead of the main branch. When all commits are done change it back to main brnch docs folder and auto deplo action will run.
